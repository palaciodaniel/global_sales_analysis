# Global Sales Analysis

[[ **VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL** ](https://github.com/palaciodaniel/global_sales_analysis/blob/main/es/README.md)]

**IMPORTANT: When this English translation was published, GitHub did not have a feature to reproduce the interactive visualizations on STEP 4B, therefore you will need to use the link provided a few paragraphs below, because it uses NBViewer.** 

This project is about an international supermarket chain, for which a complex data analysis about its sales was performed. For this reason, it was an excellent opportunity to showcase my skills to obtain and transmit key information in a business situation.

To achieve this goal, it was necessary not only to combine the information from several datasets, but also to perform a meticulous data cleaning process to fix or remove wrong observations.

A very specific characteristic of these datasets was that they were delivered without column descriptions, and also without specifying the currency or currencies in which the amounts were expressed, therefore extreme precautions had to be taken to prevent wrong assumptions and to make clear the limitations of this lack of critical information.

Regarding the visualizations, besides the popular libraries *matplotlib* and *seaborn* the excellent *plotly* was used as well, which allowed to generate the interactive graphics on the last notebook. In all cases the visualizations were thoroughly customized, by making use of the different commands and parameters these libraries offer.

The type of chosen graphics, in turn, allowed to obtain hundreds of insights, ranging from the evolution of sales during the periods registered on the dataset, to the cities and regions where the supermarket chain has its clients.

Finally, it must be noted that this project was made in a period of one week, so there are some brief mentions about possible paths that could be taken for further analyses, to keep obtaining information that could become fundamental for the company's decision making process.
